I will just make a variation of 312 since I do not have the ability to explore
the functions of LabWindows. The problem is to create a window that has a clock and LED
that starts to blink once after a certain time is reached. After the LED
has blinked for a certain amount of time it stops. The timer might continue
counting or not after the it has reached the specified value, but maybe
print the value of the timer in red to indicate that it has gone over the
timelimit. The problem would be worth 1p.

It would be solved by first, creating a new project and adding it to the workspace.
Then a LED can be added and an appropriate callback function set. We would also need to 
add a text field with a callback function. This should connect to a timer so that the
text window shows the timer value. We would then generate the code and modify it so
that we have a switch case for event. Here we could use the EVENT_TIMER_TICK property
to measure and determine when it is time to start flashing the led. The LED can be
turned on/off with SetCtrlVal(panelHandle, PANEL_LED, i) where i={0, 1}. To change
the color we would have to find a property in the textwindow to change the text based
on the value of the timer.
